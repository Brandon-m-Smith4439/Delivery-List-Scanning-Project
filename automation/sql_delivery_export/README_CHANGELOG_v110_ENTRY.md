## v110 - Live Automation Logs and Network Share Publishing Fix

- Fixed SQL workbook publishing to the shared Temp Delivery Lists UNC folder by avoiding `System.IO.File.Replace` on SMB/network paths, which caused `The path is not of a legal form.`
- Added a network-share-compatible validated overwrite path while retaining atomic replacement for supported local filesystems.
- Changed automation logging to one complete log file per run so manual and scheduled results are not mixed together.
- Rebuilt the **Status & Logs** page to stream the active command output while the automation runs instead of showing only the final 40 lines.
- Added full-log line counts, the exact log-file path, automatic follow-to-latest behavior, and a **Copy Full Log** button for troubleshooting.
- Updated scheduled-run status loading so the complete saved run log remains available after the browser or web app restarts.
- Changed app-notification publishing to use a temporary JSON request file, avoiding Windows command-line quoting and payload-length failures.
- Added clearer progress messages for workbook building, validation, destination staging, overwrite/create actions, scanner importing, and notification publishing.
- Preserved v109 authoritative **Recent Delivery List Imports** classification and retry behavior for New, Updated, New + Updated, No Changes, and Failed files.
- Preserved all scanner workflows, scan quantities, rack/bay assignments, routes, audio, notification history, and the production database.
